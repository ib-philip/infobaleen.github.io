# Data models

## What is a data model? 
A data model is made up of of 3 tables (from the sources):

* Interaction table
* User table 
* Item table 

Each line in the interaction table is linked to a user and an item in the item and user table. When we have chosen what sources should be our interaction, item and user tables we can create a data model. After this we can start creating additional information through expressions. These expressions can later be used in dashboards. The relations and overview can be seen in the below image.

When a data model is used for email analysis, the interaction becomes a specific `email sent to a user`, the user becomes `the one receiving the email`, and the email that was sent is treated as an item.

## Edit a data model
To edit and see the detailed info about a data model, you need to edit it. You can edit it by clicking the "pen" either after clicking the data model, or in the data-models list, see images below.

## Interaction Configuration
<details class="optional-class"><summary>Show more information</summary>

The interaction table specifies info about the interaction (a user interacting with an item) that includes a timestamp (ts). An interaction config can look something like below:

<h4> Field</h4>
  
This is the name of the given in the source query (it can not be changed in the data model).  
<h4> Alias</h4>

By adding an alias the the field name is replaced by the alias name in the dashboard and segmentation. In Recommendation the field name is always shown even if an alias is added.

<h4>  MLMeta</h4>
The MLMeta toggle button controls what is returned when when you make an API call. This is to give you control what data you want to return to the customer. You don't want to activate MLMeta on all fields because this will result in returning a lot of "trash columns" to the customer that they have to filter in turn get the relevant data. Note that you also have to select the role `Image` and `Format` for the product to show. MLMeta is only relevant in the recommendations view.

<h4>  MLFilter</h4>
The MLFilter lets you write expressions and filter your data in in the recommendations. You should only activate MLFilter for the fields you actually want to create a filter for, the reason for this is that when you activate **MLFilter** for a field this will store all data in the memory and every time the API calls for a recommendation the data model have to iterate through all fields with **MLFilter** resulting in a bad performance on the customers side (when the customer want to load our recommendations on their site the load speed will depend on how many **MLFilters** you have activated.

<h4> Persona</h4>
The Persona toggle button controls what columns are used in the recommendations. For example, if we activate the field `gender` as a Persona, the recommendation engine will base the recommendations on what gender the user has. If we active the field `age` it will be used as a dimension in the recommendation, and so on.

<b>Note:</b> Use a maximum of 2 columns to define persona. Alternatively, make sure that the cardinality (number of groups) is less than 1000. (ex gender: 2 different and cities: 500 different, which means `2*500 = 1000` groups)

## Custom properties
<details class="optional-class"><summary>Show more information</summary>
The Custom properties-section lets you define custom user group based on your data. The feature exploits the aggregated user data that can be found in the menu at `Model->Users`, see the image below.

<img src="../../../../images/Menu/custom_properties2.png" width="921"/>

Using for example `user.agg.first` and `user.agg.orders` as parameters `first` and `orders` it is possible to create, for example, a customer lifecycle definition as in the image below.

# Data model expression examples 
Expressions can be used to calculate certain variables, for example the amount of returned items `(SUM(returned_quantity)` or divide certain users into different categories, for example dividing the customer base into customers with or without > 1 purchases. Expressions are made in the edit mode of a data model, and later can be found and used in dashboards as parameters and metrics. 

When writing expressions, remember to check and/or modify so that the variables like `revenue`, `ts` (timestamp), `quantity` is correct according to your data. returned quantity can for example be written in different ways (example: `returnedQuantity` / `returned_quantity`)  depending on data source. returnedQuantity, returned_quantity depending on the dataset.
